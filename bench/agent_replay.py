"""Replay the SHAPE of real agent traffic, so a decode number means something for the way the box is used.

Every probe in this repo so far measures one of two regimes: a single stream that owns the box, or N streams
started together with unique salted prompts. Production is neither. R585 showed the gap is arrival shape --
prefill interleaving with in-flight decode -- and R586 showed what the real shape is, over 9,926 requests and
7.03 hours:

    prompts      median 26,032 tokens, p90 64,648        97 % prefix-cached
    concurrency  4.21 mean streams decoding
    aggregate    306.3 t/s          per stream 72.8 t/s
    acceptance   72 % MTP

The 97 % is the part no existing probe reproduces, and it is not an incidental detail: it is the difference
between a prompt costing a full prefill and costing a few hundred new tokens. It happens because an agent
session resends a GROWING conversation -- step i's prompt is step i-1's prompt plus the model's reply plus the
tool output. Every request shares a long prefix with the previous one from the same session. A probe that
salts its prompts to be unique, which every probe here does deliberately so that pool tests measure footprint
rather than reuse, produces 0 % cached and therefore the wrong prefill cost, the wrong interleaving, and the
wrong decode rate.

So this replays sessions, not requests:

    session s:  base context (a synthetic repo blob, ~BASE tokens, unique per session)
                step 0: prompt = base + task          -> force G tokens out
                step 1: prompt = base + task + reply0 + tool_output0   -> force G tokens
                step k: ... and so on, the prompt growing by (G + TOOL) tokens per step

    sessions start staggered, and between steps a session sleeps THINK seconds to stand in for tool execution,
    which is what makes concurrency fluctuate instead of sitting at a constant.

This file only GENERATES the traffic. It deliberately does not compute the headline throughput: that is done
server-side by probes/tabby_log_agg.py, reading the container log, which is the same instrument that produced
the production numbers above. Measuring both sides with one instrument is the whole point -- a replay scored
by a different method could not be compared to the thing it is replaying.

# fresh prefill work than production does, which makes it conservative for anything prefill-side.
