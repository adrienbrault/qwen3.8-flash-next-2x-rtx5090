# Decode is content-dependent — same box, same day

Date: 2026-09-16.


| shape | kind | decode (t/s) | draft acceptance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `/completions`, 4,096 forced, c1 | code | 176.3 | 62 % |
| `/completions`, 7,107 then loop-stopped, c1 | code | 187.1 | 72 % |
| chat, 512 forced, c1 | prose analysis | 94.1 | 46 % |

Drafts are sampled greedily and the target is not, so acceptance tracks how predictable the continuation is. A
decode rate without its kind is not comparable to another one.
