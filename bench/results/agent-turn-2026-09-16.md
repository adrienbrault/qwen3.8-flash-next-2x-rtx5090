# A real agent turn — DSH session `session-652732d8`, 2026-09-16

Date: 2026-09-16.


The exact task that failed before the R338 fix (build a voxel pagoda scene in one HTML file and open it in
Chrome), driven end to end by DSH Desktop through port 8022:

| quantity | value |
| --- | --- |
| steps / tool calls | 20 / 23 |
| tools used | `skill`, `todo_write`, `write`, `edit`, `bash`, `read`, `read_image` |
| output tokens | 28,931 (largest single generation 11,249) |
| prompt tokens | 22,599 fresh, **813,056 served from the paged prefix cache** |
| outcome | file written, Chrome opened, screenshots read back through the vision tower, two visual iterations, then closed |

Reasoning arrived in `reasoning_content`, short purposeful text in `content`, tool calls parsed as `tool_calls` on
every step. Against the pre-fix run of the same task: no tool call at all, 19,477 characters of degenerated
deliberation delivered as the visible answer.
